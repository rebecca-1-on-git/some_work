Business Schools and Hubris: Cause or Cure?,Eugene Sadler-Smith and Irina Cojuharenco,Academy of Management Learning  Education,01 Jun 2021,https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amle.2019.0289,"The attributes of hubris are over-confidence, arrogance, pride, and contempt for the advice and criticism of others. Hubris is fuelled by prior successes and media praise and aided and abetted by complicit followership. It manifests as recklessness and is potentially destructive in that it creates the conditions for unintended negative consequences to arise, leading potentially to destructive outcomes for individuals, organizations, and entire industries. Given the possibility of destructive outcomes emanating from hubris, its prevention and cure through management learning and education could be an important way of tempering the risks associated with a hubris hazard in business. In this essay we offer the provocation that business schools may have contributed inadvertently to the emergence of hubris, and a proposal that management learning and education is an important means for preventing hubris from taking hold in business. In doing so, we contribute to ongoing debates about business school epistemologies, curricula and pedagogies, and about the nature and purpose of business education and the institution of university business schools. We offer novel theoretical and practical contributions regarding epistemic hubris and epistemic humility, the status of humility as a meta-virtue, and how it may be possible to temper hubris by educating for humility."
Distinct but Not Apart? Stigma Reduction and Cross-Industry Evaluative Spillovers: The Case of Medical Marijuana Legalization,"Ana M. Aranda, Raffaele Conti and Filippo Carlo Wezel",Academy of Management Journal,01 Dec 2021,https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2018.1460,"Previous research on stigma reduction has been primarily confined to single industries. However, industry boundaries are porous in the eyes of audience members and can hardly act as artificial confines to moral reevaluations. We contend that evaluative spillovers induced by stigma reduction in a focal industry diffuse to other industries that share the same vilifying label when (a) they possess the morally approved attribute that underlies the reduction of stigma, and (b) the morally approved attribute is embedded in formal rules and procedures that ensure the desired purposes. Empirically, we focus our tests on the legalization of marijuana as a medicine in several U.S. states during the period 20002015, which has reduced the vice stigma around marijuana by highlighting the health safety attribute of marijuana, namely its safe consumption and potential health benefits. We show that legalization generated evaluative spillovers to other vice industries sharing the same health safety attribute as marijuana (i.e., alcohol), but not to those that did not share it (i.e., tobacco). Those spillovers were primarily observed when the law was accompanied by a patient registration system that highlighted the health safety attribute of marijuana by limiting its use to medical purposes."
Who Will Stay When Crisis Strikes? Venture CapitalistThreat-Defiant Learning Response toVentures in Crisis,Miranda J. Welbourne Eleazar and Haemin Dennis Park,Academy of Management Journal,01 Aug 2022,https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2019.1402,"Firms often depend on relationships with other firms to access important resources. When a crisis strikes a firm, the continuation of those relationships can be jeopardized, as many indirectly affected firms will leave the relationship. This abandonment can be particularly harmful if the crisis-struck firm is dependent on the relationship for valuable resources. However, some firms choose to continue their relationship with the crisis-struck firm. We consider what makes those firms resist the temptation to respond rigidly and abandon the crisis-struck firm. We contend that firms that defy such indirect threats do so as a result of threat-defiant learning, which stems from confidence gained from their prior relational experiences. We test this concept in the context of venture capital firms (VCs) investments after venture crises in the form of venture involvement in a lawsuit. Studying 435 VCs decisions on whether to continue to invest in 105 ventures experiencing lawsuits, we find support for threat-defiant learning. This study contributes to the literature on crisis, threat rigidity, and entrepreneurship by showing how firms can resist threat rigidity in interfirm relationships, specifically how VCs learn from experience to defy threats posed by venture lawsuits and make post-lawsuit follow-on investments."
"Platform-Dependent Entrepreneurs: Power Asymmetries, Risks, and Strategies in the Platform Economy",Donato Cutolo and Martin Kenney,Academy of Management Perspectives,01 Nov 2021,https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amp.2019.0103,"Online digital platforms organize and mediate an ever-increasing share of economic and societal activities. Moreover, the opportunities that platform-mediated markets offer not only attract enormous numbers of entrepreneurs but also support the growth of entire ecosystems of producers, sellers, and specialized service providers. The increased economic and business significance of digital platforms has attracted myriad studies exploring their power dynamics and general impact. This research has largely overlooked the power imbalance that entrepreneurs experience as members of the platform ecosystem, and provided little guidance on how these far more numerous firms should compete. Drawing upon power-dependence theory, we show that the power asymmetry in the relationship between the platform and its ecosystem members is intrinsic to the economics and the technological architecture of digital platforms. We conceptually analyze the sources of this power, and we unravel the novel component of risks that emanate from this imbalance. Our analysis suggests that the conditions of engagement for platform entrepreneurs are so different from traditional entrepreneurship that these entrepreneurs are more usefully termed platform-dependent entrepreneurs (PDEs). Further, we explore the strategies that PDEs are developing to mitigate their dependence. Finally, our study provides a framework for policy-makers that are considering regulating platform-organized markets."
Feelings for the Planet: An Alternative Vocabularyfor Incorporating Biosphere-FocusedEmotions into Management Learning andEducation,Mark G. Edwards and Wendelin Kpers,Academy of Management Learning  Education,Not found,https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amle.2023.0180,"We present a vocabulary for biosphere-focused emotions and discuss its relevance and application to management learning and education (MLE). In the context of growing societal concern about global environmental crises, the study of emotions in humannature relations occupies an increasingly important position in sustainability studies. There is a scarcity, however, of both conceptual and applied tools for supporting MLE pedagogy regarding emotions toward nature, especially at the planetary scale. To address this, we pursue two lines of inquiry under the theoretical framing of a vocabulary perspective. First, we pursue the empirical task of developing an alternative vocabulary consisting of items that express emotions toward global-scale ecologies and natural systemsthat is, biosphere-focused emotions. A structured vocabulary of 50 items, six themes, and two integrative dimensions is developed based on online search techniques, inductive text analysis, and theme analysis. Second, we provide illustrative examples, a lesson-design tool, and lesson plan for applying the alternative vocabulary in sustainability studies in MLE. We conclude with a discussion of the limitations of the study and avenues for further research."
How Fear of Looming Megacatastrophes Alters Entrepreneurial Activity Rates through Psychological Distance,"Bari Bendell, Diane M. Sullivan and Suzyn Ornstein",Academy of Management Perspectives,01 Nov 2020,https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amp.2019.0049,"Currently, the global mood is one of anxiety and fear over looming megacatastrophes (LMCs) such as climate change, pandemics, or nuclear war. The important implications of these proliferating fears in the broader public notwithstanding, we concern ourselves with how this widespread and growing fear of impending doomwhich we refer to as Big-F Fearrelates to entrepreneurial activity. While a host of fears (e.g. fears of failure, rejection) have been explored theoretically and empirically in the entrepreneurship literature, the dominant approach to examining fear has mostly been individual and situation specific across a limited time framei.e., little-f fears. We aim to explore whether entrepreneurship works the same way in the context of Big F Fear (i.e. the fear of impending doom that exists across large populations simultaneously, over an extended period of time) as it does under normal conditions. In doing so, we draw on construal-level theory to explain how entrepreneurs perceptions of their psychological distance to the effects of an LMC relate to affective (i.e., Fear) and behavioral (i.e., entrepreneurial activity) outcomes."
